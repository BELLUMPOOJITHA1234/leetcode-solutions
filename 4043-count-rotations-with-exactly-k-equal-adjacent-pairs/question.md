You are given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

A **cyclic rotation** of `s` is obtained by choosing a **prefix** of `s` whose length is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), and moving it to the end of the string while preserving the order of all characters.

For **every** cyclic rotation of `s`, let its **score** be the number of indices `i` such that `0 Example 1:

**Input:** s = "aab", k = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The cyclic rotations of `s` are:

	- `"aab"`: The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so `score = 1`.

	- `"aba"`: No two adjacent characters are equal, so `score = 0`.

	- `"baa"`: The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so `score = 1`.

Since `score` equals `k` for 2 cyclic rotations of `s`, the answer is 2.

Example 2:

**Input:** s = "abca", k = 0

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The cyclic rotations of `s` are:

	- `"abca"`: No two adjacent characters are equal, so `score = 0`.

	- `"bcaa"`: The characters at positions 2 and 3 are equal, so `score = 1`.

	- `"caab"`: The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so `score = 1`.

	- `"aabc"`: The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so `score = 1`.

Since `score` equals `k` for only 1 cyclic rotation of `s`, the answer is 1.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n == s.length <= 100`

	- `s` only consists of lowercase English letters.

	- `0 <= k <= n - 1`
